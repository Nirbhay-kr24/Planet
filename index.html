              Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, with a diameter of 4,880 km. It has no atmosphere, causing
              extreme temperature variations, reaching 430°C during the day and -180°C at night. Mercury’s orbit takes
              88 Earth days, and it rotates very slowly, completing one spin in 59 days. The planet's surface is heavily
              cratered, similar to Earth's Moon. Mercury has no moons and a very weak magnetic field. Its surface
              experiences intense solar radiation. Despite being closest to the Sun, it is not the hottest planet.

              thick, toxic atmosphere mainly of carbon dioxide, causing an extreme greenhouse effect that makes it the
              hottest planet in the Solar System, with temperatures reaching 465°C. The planet rotates slowly in the
              opposite direction to most planets, taking 243 Earth days to complete one rotation. Venus has no moons.
              Its surface is covered by volcanic plains and mountain ranges. Despite its beauty, Venus’s surface is
              uninhabitable.

              a diameter of 116,460 km. It is a gas giant, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, and is famous for
              its beautiful ring system. The rings are made of ice and rock particles. Saturn has at least 146 moons,
              with Titan being the largest. Titan is unique for having a thick atmosphere and lakes of liquid methane.
              Saturn’s winds can reach speeds of 1,800 km/h. The planet’s rotation takes just 10.7 hours, but its orbit

                  The Sun is a star at the center of the Solar System, providing essential light and heat to Earth.
                  Composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, it undergoes nuclear fusion in its core. The Sun has a

                  of 1.39 million km and is 109 times larger than Earth. It’s approximately 4.6 billion years old. The
                  Sun’s gravity keeps the planets in orbit, while its solar wind influences space weather. It will
                  continue shining for about 5 billion more years, eventually expanding into a red giant.From Earth, it

            The Chandrayaan programme (Sanskrit: Candra 'Moon', Yāna 'Craft, Vehicle',)
            also known as the Indian Lunar Exploration Programme is an ongoing series of outer
            space missions by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) for the exploration of the Moon. The program
            incorporates a lunar orbiter, an impactor, a soft lander and a rover spacecraft.

            There have been three missions so far with a total of two orbiters, landers and rovers each. While the two
            orbiters were successful, the first lander and rover which were part of the Chandrayaan-2 mission, crashed
            on the surface. The second lander and rover mission Chandrayaan-3 successfully landed on the Moon on 23
            August 2023, making India the first nation to successfully land a spacecraft in the lunar south pole region,
            and the fourth country to soft land on the Moon after the Soviet Union, the United States and China.
